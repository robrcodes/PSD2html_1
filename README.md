# PSD to HTML

This repository contains the web development code used to convert a photoshop PSD design comp of a web landing page into a working HTML template page.

This landing page was created to be mobile first responsive, from a single static comp, therefore it is not pixel perfect. This is a natural side effect of producing fluid and adaptive pages for more than just one screen size.

This page was also coded using [Flex Box](http://caniuse.com/#search=flex) CSS and is therefore only compatible with the latest browsers (not IE). I have intentionally not used a fallback.

## Tools / Workflows

The following frameworks/tools were used:
* HTML / CSS
* Sass (scss)
* JavaScript / jQuery:
* scrollReveal, scrollTo
* Google font: Lato
* Font Awesome icons
* Gulp, Bower, & Git


## PSD Design

This landing page was designed by [Evgenia Kornienko](https://www.behance.net/JaneKorn)

Adobe [Creative Cloud Extract](http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/extract.html) was used to source the graphical elements and font information.
